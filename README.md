## Google Analytics Configuration

### Visitor Counter Configuration

The site includes a visitor counter powered by CountAPI:

1. The counter is already set up with namespace key 'alanszuster-portfolio'
2. It tracks both total visits and daily visits
3. Each visitor is counted once per browser session
4. No additional setup is needed - the counter works out of the box

For Google Analytics setup:

1. Create a Google Analytics account at [https://analytics.google.com/](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Create a new property and get your measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Replace the placeholder `G-MEASUREMENT_ID` in `templates/base.html` with your actual measurement ID
