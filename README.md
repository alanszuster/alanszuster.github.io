## Google Analytics Configuration

To set up the visitor counter with Google Analytics:

1. Create a Google Analytics account at https://analytics.google.com/
2. Create a new property and get your measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Replace the placeholder `G-MEASUREMENT_ID` in `templates/base.html` with your actual measurement ID
4. The visitor counter will now track using Google Analytics data

Note: The counter on the page uses localStorage to provide immediate visual feedback, while actual analytics data is collected by Google Analytics.
