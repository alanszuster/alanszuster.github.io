# Alan Szuster - Personal Website

This is my personal website showcasing my work as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). The site highlights my expertise in cloud infrastructure, system automation, monitoring, and development skills, with AI/ML projects as side endeavors. The site is built using Flask and Flask-Frozen to generate static files, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Visitor Counter Configuration

The site includes a visitor counter powered by CountAPI:

1. The counter is already set up with namespace key 'alanszuster-portfolio'
2. It tracks both total visits and daily visits
3. Each visitor is counted once per browser session
4. No additional setup is needed - the counter works out of the box
